      <p><strong>Note: </strong>A certificate of qualification lets people work in some skilled trades in Canada. Only the provinces, territories and a federal body can issue these certificates. To get one, a person must have them assess their training, trade experience and skills to and then pass a certification exam.</p>
      <p> People usually have to go to the province or territory to be assessed. They may also need experience and training from an employer in Canada. </p>
      <p>This isnâ€™t the same as a nomination from a province or territory.</p>
